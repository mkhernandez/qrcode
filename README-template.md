## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I found that there can be multiple ways to accomplish the same result. I played around with some of the containerization of html elements and finally settled on a card like layout consisting of a div element with a container class and another div with a card class. From there I added another three divs into the card each with their own class: img, heading, and content.



```html
standard html
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```
```js
no js in this challenge
```

### Continued development

I want to continue working on css as there are many ways of accomplishing the same output. It seems that the layout of the component can vary greatly and with that the styling applied will also vary. Therefore, it would be beneficial to learn multiple ways of making a website responsive since this can be done as such.
